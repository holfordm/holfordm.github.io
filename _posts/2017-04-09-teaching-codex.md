I wrote a post for the excellent [Teaching the Codex](https://teachingthecodex.wordpress.com/) project, which among other things promotes resources for teaching codicology and palaeography - basically, the study of manuscripts and handwriting. My post is a short introduction to the catalogues in which manuscripts are described, and the conventions of manuscript description. It aims to make these sometimes dense and forbidding descriptions a bit more approachable. You can read it [here](https://teachingthecodex.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/reading-a-manuscript-description/)

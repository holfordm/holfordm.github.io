This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Jekyll isn't officially supported on Windows, but it wasn't too tricky to do. There are some good instructions by Anna Debenham [here](https://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) and by Amanda Visconti at the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) site.

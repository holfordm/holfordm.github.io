I am a medievalist and historian whose work currently focusses on digital encoding and publishing. I am a curator at the Bodleian Library, where I am working on a new digital catalogue of the library's medieval manuscripts. I also work on  [Mapping the Medieval Countryside](http://www.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk), a digital edition of the medieval English inquisitions post mortem.
